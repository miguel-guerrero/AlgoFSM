Guide to the tests provided there:
----------------------------------

motor       - a simple garage door motor controller (a classic FSM example)

matmul1     - simple matrix x vector multiplication using nested
              while loops and tasks for memory requests

matmul2     - as above but using do/while loops and macros for
              memory requests. Also math in a separate controller
              to avoid dead cycles (higher throughput)

matmul3     - as above

for1        - for loop test
for2
for3
for4

test_seq2
test_seq3

tpg1        - video test pattern generator, generates syncs and pixels contents
tpg2        - as above 
tpg3        - as above but using a couple of nested for loops


Experimental/In-progress:
-------------------------
spi-s       - SPI slave controller
ahb-lite-m  - AHB master controller
